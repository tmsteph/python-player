This is a readme File

It explains a bit about the software and what it's meant to do.

Thanks for listening. 


Hello. 


This is a command line player. 

I'll make the gui later if neccesary. 

Meant to play all media files such as powerpoint, mp3, mp4, and others. 

It uses the ffmpeg library as well as imagemagik and other libraries. 

 
pyqt6 looks interesting.
